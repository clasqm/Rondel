<p>Written in yab using the Yabadabbadoo IDE, but you can load the file Rondel.yab in the "binder" directory into the Official yab IDE.</p>

<p>Written under Haiku x86_64 Beta 1, emulated under QEMU on a Linux Host. I am no longer testing my applications on 32-bit Haiku, but you are of course welcome to try.</p>

<p>MIT -LIcensed software.</p>

<p><strong>Dependencies:</strong>
* yab
* aspell
* perl
* sed
* awk
* python

* htmldoc</p>

<p>To compile in Yabadabbadoo, the file "mainloop" and the contents of the entire "sub" directory from <a href="https://github.com/clasqm/Rondel">Trope</a> must be copied or symlinked within Rondel's directory. These files will not normally appear in the Rondel github repository.</p>
